### Introduction to Deep Learning
* AI is the new electricity, where one of the fields of AI is rising rapidly is deep learning.
***

## Course consists of 5 courses as sequence they are:
    1. Neural networks and Deep learning
    2. Improving Deep Neural network: Hyper parameter tuning, Regualarization, and optimization
    3. Structuring your machine learning project
    4. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
    5. Sequence models (RNN, LSTM)

***
* In neural network where input data goes through hidden layer (function) and outputs the output, the common function is Relu (rectified linear unit).

* Relu - it is an activation function in neural networks, where it takes value and outputs max value from 0,z where if z is negative output is zero. (or) The rectified linear activation function or ReLU for short is a piecewise linear function that will output the input directly if it is positive,otherwise, it will output zero. [ReLU link @machinelearningmastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/ "ReLU link")

* A neural network have a Input layer (where it takes inputs), hidden layer (where it does all the ocmputaitons and store weights) and output layer where the output is displayed. most of the neural network is used to solve supervised learning.

* Human's are great at understanding and recognizing the unstructured data, where on other hand neural networks are better at understanding unstructured data (such as images, music files, text data, etc.,)

* To get higher perfromance out of neural neural network we need to create larger neural network with more amount of layers and require very large amount of data andrew ng explains this in video called why deep learning is takin off, he also explains that using the smaller dataset it really odesnt matter if we use machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision Tress, etc or any neural network it will overall yield similar results (limitation is smaller set of data). please find the belo graph whihc explains you clearly!
