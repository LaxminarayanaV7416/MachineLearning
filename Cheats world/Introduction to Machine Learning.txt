1. What is Machine Learning?
    -> A computer program is said to learn from Experience (E) with respect to some Task (T) and some Performance Measure
    (P), if Performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
    -> Experience is DATA.
    -> Performance Measure is Accuracy, Precision, F1 Score, Recall.
    -> Task is our end goal.

2. Basic Terminology in Machine Learning.
    -> Attribute = Column Name
    -> Value = Instace of the column and row
    -> Features = Attribute + Value
    -> Labels -> Generally called outputs present in DATA
    -> Target 
    -> Stratified Data = Sample data which represent the entire population. eg., in etire population of books we have 
        63% Maths and 37% Science then sample should also consist the same.
    -> Dataframe = DataFrame is a 2-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types.
    -> Feature extraction
    -> Cost Function
    -> Learning Rate
    -> Hyperparameters = parameters of learning algorithm not the model.


3. Different Types of data?
    -> Quantitative Data (Numerical data) -> Data consists of numerical statements (Numeric Based) eg. Age, weight, etc.,
	    1.	Discrete data - represent items that can be counted; they take on possible values that can be listed out. The list of possible values may be fixed (also called finite).
	    2.	Continuous data - represent measurements; their possible values cannot be counted and can only be described using intervals on the real number line. For example, the exact amount of gas purchased at the pump for 
        cars with 20-gallon tanks would be continuous data from 0 gallons to 20 gallons, represented by the interval [0, 20].
    -> Qualitative Data (categorical data) -> Data consists of descriptive statements (Text Based) eg. Person Name,  person's gender, etc.,
    Further Deep:
    1.	categorical 
		a.	Nominal data
		b.	Ordinal data
	2.	Numerical
		a.	Interval data
		b.	Ratio data

4. Different types of Machine Learning Systems?
    -> Trained under Human Supervision:
        1. Supervisied Learning 
            a. Classification 
            b. Regression
                ALGORITHMS:
                    >> K-Nearest Neighbors
                    >> Linear Regression
                    >> Logisitic Regression
                    >> Support Vector Machines (SVM)
                    >> Decision Trees
                    >> Random Forests
                    >> Neural Networks
        2. Unsupervised Learning
            a. Clustering
            b. Visualization
            c. Dimensionality Reduction
            d. Assosciation Rule Learning
                ALGORITHMS
                    >> K-means 
                    >> Hierarchial Clustering
                    >> Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
                    >> Kernal PCA 
                    >> Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)
                    >> t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
                    >> Apriori
                    >> Eclat
        3. Semi Supervisied Learning
        4. Reinforcement Learning
    -> Learning Incrementally on Fly:
        1. Online Learning -> Out-of-core Learning and Learning Rate
        2. Batch Learning / Offline Learning
    -> Mechanism of Learning from data / How they generalise the data:
        1. Instance Based Learning
        2. Model Based Learning

5. Main Challenges in Machine Learning:
    -> Insufficient Quantity of Data
    -> Non representative Training Data = Sampling Bias
    -> Poor Quality Data
    -> Irrelavant Features = Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Feature extraction
    -> Overfitting the Training Data = Regularisation
    -> Testing and Validation data sets = Cross Validation
